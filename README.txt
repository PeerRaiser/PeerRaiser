PeerRaiser makes it easy to create powerful peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns on your own WordPress site.

== Description ==

**[PeerRaiser](https://peerraiser.com/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=home&utm_campaign=readme)** makes it easy to create powerful peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns on your own WordPress site.

Empower individuals and teams to recruit new constituents and fundraise in support of your organization.

= Powerful =

PeerRaiser is fully featured. You can create unlimited campaigns and fundraisers. There are no "add-ons" or extensions to pay for. New features are added on a regular basis to make it even more powerful.

= Customizable =

This plugin takes full advantage of WordPress' awesome "hooks" system. You can easily customize PeerRaiser by using the built-in actions and filters throughout the plugin.

In addition, the plugin separates the HTML from the PHP into templates that can be overwritten.

To overwrite a template, create a "peerraiser" folder in your theme folder, and copy the template from the "views" folder into it. Make sure to keep the same folder structure.

For example, to customize the donation form, you could copy `views/frontend/donation-form.php` and place it in `your-theme/peerraiser/frontend/donation-form.php`, and then make your changes.

Note: We suggest using hooks instead of using this method, whenever possible.

= Easy =

PeerRaiser is so easy to use, you can get setup and accepting donations in minutes! There's no need to mess with SSL certificates or setup complicated merchant accounts.
